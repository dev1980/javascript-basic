//What are first class function ?

//What is Anonymous Functions ( function with no name we call it anonymous function.)



//Function statement 

function a() {
    console.log("hello")
}

// Function Expression

var b = function() {
    console.log("display B")
}

// Difference between function statement and expression is Hoisting.

//Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope before code execution. Inevitably, 
//this means that no matter where functions and variables are declared, they are moved to the top of their scope regardless of whether their scope is global or local


//Function Declaration ?
